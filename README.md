## About me
My name is [Wojciech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wojciech).

It’s Slavic name and means something like “He who is happy in battle“. However origin maybe fits 1 000 years ago to warriors or any other persons enjoying of war. So right now it’s just tradition to name children like their grandpas. As the result I’m only “happy in battle” if I get top rank in Battlefield gameplay.

My surname means nothing. However it seems core “Pazdzier” is connected somehow to October (pol: pazdziernik) and tail “-wicz” is the end of typical polish surname occured in XVI century in Lithuania. Whatever.

To avoid rising entropy in the Universe because of posting doubled info You are welcome to have a look into my Linkedin profile to find more details about experience, skills and overall technical background:
