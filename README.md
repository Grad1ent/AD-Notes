## About me
My name is [Wojciech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wojciech).

It’s Slavic name and means something like “He who is happy in battle“. However origin maybe fits 1 000 years ago to warriors or any other persons enjoying of war. Right now it’s more like tradition to name children like their grandpas.

My surname or at least core “Pazdzier” seems to be connected somehow to October (pol: pazdziernik) and tail “-wicz” is the end of typical polish surnames occured in XVI century in Lithuania. Interesting.

To avoid rising entropy in the Universe due of posting doubled info You are very welcome to have a look into my Linkedin profile to find more details about experience, skills and overall technical background:
